# Installation

This page describes how to integrate the Scandit Data Capture SDK into your Xamarin iOS project.

## Prerequisites

- The latest stable version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- A Xamarin.iOS project with minimum iOS deployment target of 13.0 or higher. Or a Xamarin.Android project with target SDK version 23 (Android 6, Marshmallow) or higher.
- A valid Scandit Data Capture SDK license key. You can sign up for a free [test account](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard/sign-up?p=test&utm%5Fsource=documentation).

:::note
Android devices running the Scandit Data Capture SDK need to have a GPU or the performance will drastically decrease.

## Get a License Key

1. [Sign up](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard/sign-up?p=test) or [Sign in](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard/sign-in)
   to your Scandit account
2. Create a project
3. Create a license key

If you have a paid subscription, please reach out to [Scandit Support](mailto:support@scandit.com) if you need a new license key.

## Add the SDK

The Scandit Data Capture SDK is distributed as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=scandit).

You will always need to add the Scandit.DataCapture.Core.Xamarin package, which contains the core functionality used by the other data capture packages. In addition, depending on the data capture task, you will need a reference to:

- Scandit.DataCapture.Barcode.Xamarin ([ScanditBarcodeCapture API](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api.html)) if you want to use barcode-related functionality such as barcode capture or MatrixScan.
- Scandit.DataCapture.Parser.Xamarin ([ScanditParser API](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/parser/api.html)) if you want to parse data strings, e.g. as found in barcodes, into a set of key-value mappings.

You can safely remove `Scandit.DataCapture.Barcode.Xamarin`, `Scandit.DataCapture.Parser.Xamarin` dependencies if you are not going to use their features.

## Additional Information

### Camera Permissions

When using the Scandit Data Capture SDK you will want to set the camera as the frame source for various capture modes. On Xamarin.Android, you have to request camera permissions in your own application before starting scanning. To see how you can achieve this, take a look at our [samples](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-xamarin-samples).
