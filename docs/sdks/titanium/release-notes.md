## 7.0.0-beta2

**Released**: November 22, 2024

### New Features

Scandit's Smart Data Capture SDK v7.0 addresses the industry's toughest scanning challenges with innovative solutions at every layer. Our enhanced scanning engine is context-aware, understanding both the environment and user needs. This results in smoother integrations, a richer user experience, and improved scanning performance without compromising flexibility.

Version 7.0 also offers increased versatility by supporting multiple input formats including text and barcodes.

#### Barcode

* Added the `remove_delimiter_data` extension to the CODABAR symbology.

#### Core

* Added the following API for fetching all Open Source Software (OSS) license text and attributions for all OSS used by the Scandit SDK.
  * `DataCaptureContext.openSourceSoftwareLicenseInfo()`

### Performance Improvements

* Improved tracking of 1D barcodes that are horizontally aligned.

### Deprecations

In 7.0, we removed several APIs that were deprecated during the lifetime of 6.0. Before [migrating to 7.0](/migrate-6-to-7.md), we suggest upgrading to 6.28, fixing all deprecation warnings and then upgrading to 7.0.
