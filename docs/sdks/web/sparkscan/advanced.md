# Advanced Configurations

SparkScan is optimized by default for efficiency, accuracy, and a seamless user experience. However, there are some cases where you might want to customize the behavior of SparkScan. This guide will show you how to add additional capabilities and further customize SparkScan to best fit your needs.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Trigger Error State

You may want to introduce logic in your app to show an error message when scanning specific barcodes (e.g. barcodes already added to the list, barcodes from the wrong lot etc.). SparkScan offers a built-in error state you can easily set to trigger an error feedback prompt to the user. You will be able to customize:

- The text message
- The timeout of the error message: the scanner will be paused for the specified amount of time, but the user can quickly restart the scanning process by tapping the trigger button

    :::tip
    A high timeout (>10s) typically requires the users to interact with the UI to start scanning again. This is a good choice when you want to interrupt the scanning workflow (e.g. because a wrong barcode is scanned and some actions need to be performed). A small timeout (\<2s) could allow the user to scan again without having to interact with the app, just momentarily pausing the workflow to acknowledge that a “special” barcode has been scanned.
    :::

- The color of the flashing screen upon scan. You can enable or disable the visual feedback via [SparkScanViewSettings.visualFeedbackEnabled](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/ui/spark-scan-view-settings.html#property-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanViewSettings.VisualFeedbackEnabled) and you can control the color via [SparkScanViewSuccessFeedback](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/ui/spark-scan-view-feedback.html#class-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanViewSuccessFeedback) and [SparkScanViewErrorFeedback](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/ui/spark-scan-view-feedback.html#class-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanViewErrorFeedback).

To emit an error, you have to implement a [`SparkScanFeedbackDelegate`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/spark-scan-feedback-delegate.html#interface-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.feedback.ISparkScanFeedbackDelegate) and set it to the `SparkScanView`:

```js
sparkScanView.feedbackDelegate  = sparkScanFeedbackDelegate;
```

In the [`SparkScanFeedbackDelegate.getFeedbackForBarcode()`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/spark-scan-feedback-delegate.html#method-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.feedback.ISparkScanFeedbackDelegate.GetFeedbackForBarcode) you can then return an error or a success feedback:

```js
const sparkScanFeedbackDelegate = {
      feedbackForBarcode: (barcode: Barcode) => {
          if (isValidBarcode(barcode)) {
              return new SparkScanBarcodeSuccessFeedback();
          } else {
              return new SparkScanBarcodeErrorFeedback(
                  'This code should not have been scanned',
                  60 * 1000,
                  Color.fromHex('#FF0000'),
                  new Brush(Color.fromHex('#FF0000'), Color.fromHex('#FF0000'), 1),
              );
          }
      },
};
```

You can have different error states triggered by different logic conditions. These errors can show different colors and have different timeouts. For example:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/sparkscan/error-wrong.png" alt="Wrong scan error" /><br></br>This error state for a code that should not have been scanned.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/sparkscan/error-duplicate.png" alt="Duplicate scan error" /><br></br>This error state for a code that has been scanned more than once.
</p>

### Reject Barcodes

To prevent scanning unwanted barcodes (like those already listed or from incorrect lots), use SparkScan’s built-in error state. Setting the [`SparkScanBarcodeErrorFeedback.resumeCapturingDelay`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/ui/spark-scan-barcode-feedback.html#property-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.feedback.Error.ResumeCapturingDelay) parameter to 0 allows the user to continue scanning immediately without pausing on rejected codes.

### Add Advanced Scanning Modes to the Setting Toolbar

SparkScan is our best solution for high-speed single scanning and scan-intensive workflows. Depending on your use case, you can use SparkScan scan in conjunction with other Scandit advanced scanning modes, such as MatrixScan Find or MatrixScan Count, to speed up your workflows.

SparkScan offers pre-build buttons you can add to the setting toolbar to easily move to different scan modes from within the SparkScan UI.

First you will need to show these buttons:

```js
// Show the MatrixScan Count and MatrixScan Find buttons
sparkScanView.barcodeCountButtonVisible = true;
sparkScanView.barcodeFindButtonVisible = true;
```

## UI Customization

:::tip
Please refer to [SparkScanView](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/ui/spark-scan-view.html#class-scandit.datacapture.barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanView) for the full list of parameters.
