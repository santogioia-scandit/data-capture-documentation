## 6.28.0-beta-1

**Released**: September 10, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

* BarcodeFind is an API that implements [MatrixScan Find](/sdks/web/matrixscan-find/intro.md). MatrixScan Find is a pre-built UI that uses augmented reality overlays to highlight items that match predefined criteria. It allows you to add a search and find experience with augmented reality to an existing native app, with just a few lines of code.
* On Barcode Capture and SparkScan, we optimized the frame processing time in 4k-UHD resolution with dynamic resolution selection, resulting in up to 35% reduction on high-end devices and consistent performance improvements across all supported devices.
platforms.

#### ID

* ID Capture now supports scanning the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) on the back of the European  Health Insurance Card.
* ID Capture supports scanning the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) of New York City IDs.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed result data encoding classification for raw byte data in 2d barcodes, in particular for Shift-JIS encoding.
* Resolved cases in which Smart Scan Intention was possibly reporting the wrong barcode when when the camera was quickly changing direction with a single barcode in the scene.
* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to scan non-fluorescent French-Post barcodes without the extension `fluorescent_orange_ink`.

## 6.24.0

**Released**: May 8, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

- **Smart Scan Intention**: Introduced a new algorithm named "smart" that intelligently identifies and scans the intended barcode, reducing errors. It can be manually set in Barcode Capture (`BarcodeCaptureSettings.scanIntention`).

- **Advanced Barcode Tracking for WebSDK**: Added advanced Barcode Tracking capabilities with `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay`, an overlay for `DataCaptureView` that allows anchoring a single user-provided View to each tracked barcode. Users can configure the view displayed for a barcode and its relative position by implementing `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlayListener` or by calling `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setViewForTrackedBarcode()`, `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setAnchorForTrackedBarcode()`, or `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setOffsetForTrackedBarcode()`. For more information, refer to the "Add AR Overlays in MatrixScan" documentation.

#### ID

  - Mexico: Matrícula Consular

- **New Feature for French Passports**: Added `CapturedId.secondaryLastName` containing the common name (“nom d’usage”) on French passports.

### Performance Improvements

#### ID

- **Improved Capture Performance**: Enhanced capture performance for US driver’s license PDF417 barcodes with printing defects, particularly from Ohio, Louisiana, and Florida.

#### ID

- Fixed a crash when scanning a passport MRZ followed by a non-passport VIZ.
- Fixed an issue causing the century of birth dates, issue dates, and expiry dates to be returned incorrectly when scanning the VIZ of European IDs, Swiss driver’s licenses, and UAE IDs.
- Fixed instances where information was incorrectly extracted from British Columbia PDF417.

### New Features

#### Barcode

- Updated the camera behavior to overcome the scanning challenges found on the iPhone 13 Pro (Max) and iPhone 14 Pro (Max) when using the built-in camera for barcode scanning. Our testing showed that barcodes that are less than 2 cm or ~1 inch in size (and usually have such small features) were impacted.

#### ID

- New textual hints and animations guide the user if the camera is too close or too far to capture a document.
- Redesigned ID Capture viewfinders to enable smoother drawing performance.
- For ID cards issued by the United Arab Emirates, data parsed from the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) is now returned automatically when `IdDocumentType.IdCardVIZ` and `SupportedSides.FrontAndBack` are selected.
- Added textual hints and animations appearing when the document is detected to be too close or too far from the camera.
- Improved recognition of cropped ID document images when using the `SingleImageUploader` frame source.

#### Core

- Added property `SingleImageUploaderSettings.onlyCameraCapture` to force the image to be captured by the camera instead of allowing the selection of an image from the device’s photo library.
- Added `ImageFrameSource`. This new type of `FrameSource` allows processing a single image, file, or [`ImageData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData).
- Added `Camera.settings` to `Camera`.

### Bug Fixes

#### ID

- Fixed an issue where hints were not being shown when the `DataCaptureView` is attached after the `id.IdCapture` instance is created.

#### Core

- Restored some logs that were not being properly sent to the console anymore.

### API Changes

#### ID

- Added `IdCaptureOverlay.setMoveCloserTextHint()` and `IdCaptureOverlay.setMoveFurtherAwayTextHint()` that allow setting custom text for textual hints displayed when scanning a document.
