# iOS SDK Samples

This page provides a list of samples available for the Scandit Data Capture SDK for iOS. Each sample demonstrates a specific feature or use case of the SDK.

The repository with all the samples can be found [here](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master), and each individual sample is linked below.

## Barcode Scanning

### Single Scanning

#### Barcode Capture


##### [Single Scan](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeCaptureSimpleSampleSwift)

Simple sample showing how to use the Barcode Capture mode to scan a single barcode.

:::tip
This sample is written in Swift. If you prefer Objective-C, you can find the equivalent sample [here](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeCaptureSimpleSampleObjC).

##### [Capture Views](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeCaptureViewsSample)

Demonstrates the various ways to best integrate the scanner into the UI of your app.

##### [Capture Settings](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeCaptureSettingsSample)

Demonstrates how you can adapt the barcode capture settings best to your needs and experiment with all the options.

##### [Rejection](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeCaptureRejectSample)

Sample that uses the camera to read a single QR code that starts with “09:” but ignores/rejects all other codes.

#### Pre-built Workflows

##### SparkScan

###### [List Building](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/ListBuildingSample)

Use SparkScan to populate a list of scanned barcodes.

###### [Receiving](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/ReceivingSample)

Use a combination of SparkScan and [MatrixScan Count](#matrixscan-count) for a receiving use case.

##### Barcode Selection

###### [Selection Settings](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/BarcodeSelectionSettingsSample)

Demonstrates how you can adapt the barcode selection settings best to your needs and experiment with all the options.

###### [Reorder from Catalog](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/ReorderFromCatalogSample)

Sample showing how Barcode Selection can be used to reorder items from a catalog, enabling the user to tap the products that need to be reordered.

### Multi-Scanning

#### MatrixScan AR

Examples utilizing the low-level [`BarcodeTracking`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/ios/barcode-capture/api/barcode-tracking.html) API.

##### [Simple Highlight](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/MatrixScanSimpleSample)

Simple sample showing how to use MatrixScan to highlight barcodes in a frame.

##### [Rejection](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/MatrixScanRejectSample)

Use custom conditions to highlight and scan only the barcodes that meet the specified criteria.

#### Pre-built Workflows

##### MatrixScan Count

![MatrixScan Count](/img/samples/ms_count.png)

###### [Batch Scanning](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/MatrixScanCountSimpleSample)

Use MatrixScan to batch scan and count the number of barcodes in a frame.

###### [Receiving](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/ReceivingSample)

Use a combination of [SparkScan](#sparkscan) and MatrixScan Count for a receiving use case.

###### [Expiry Management](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/ExpiryManagementSample)

Share scan data between MatrixScan Count and Spark Scan to show the expiration status of scanned items.

##### MatrixScan Find

![MatrixScan Find](/img/samples/ms_find_ios.png)

###### [Search and Find](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/SearchAndFindSample)

Use barcode capture to define search criteria by scanning items, and MatrixScan Find can then be launched to find the pre-defined item.
