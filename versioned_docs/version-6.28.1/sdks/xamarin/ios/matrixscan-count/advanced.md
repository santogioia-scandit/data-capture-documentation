# Advanced Configurations

MatrixScan Count is optimized by default for efficiency, accuracy, and a seamless user experience. However, there are multiple advanced settings available to further customize MatrixScan Count to best fit your needs.

## Scanning Against A List

There is a function to set a list of expected barcodes if you are scanning against a manifest or item list. If this is used, a progress bar is added to the UI, so you can keep track of the process while scanning.

When scanning against a list, the UI will also show red icons to mark scanned barcodes that aren’t present on the list.

```csharp
List<TargetBarcode> targetBarcodes = new List<TargetBarcode>();
targetBarcodes.Add(TargetBarcode.Create("data", 1));
BarcodeCountCaptureList captureList = BarcodeCountCaptureList.Create(this, targetBarcodes);
barcodeCount.SetBarcodeCountCaptureList(captureList);
```

## Barcode Count Status

This feature is used to provide users with more details regarding the items they’re scanning in order to aid effective handling. The icons (available as part of the SDK) appear as an AR overlay after tapping the “Status Mode” button and can be used to highlight the following:

- Expired products
- Items requiring quality inspection
- Items that are low in stock
- Wrong items
- Fragile items

## Strap Mode

It can be difficult to reach the shutter button if the smart device is attached to the user’s wrist by a strap or similar. In this instance, you can enable a floating shutter button that can be positioned by the end user in a more ergonomically suitable position.

```csharp
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowFloatingShutterButton = true;
```

## Filtering

If you have several types of barcodes on your label/package, you may want to scan only one of them.

In this case, you can filter the others out. This can be done by symbology, symbol count, or setting a regex.

For example, you might want to scan only Code 128 barcodes and no PDF417 ones.

```csharp
BarcodeCountSettings settings = new BarcodeCountSettings();
barcodeCountSettings.EnableSymbologies(enabledSymbologies);

settings.FilterSettings.ExcludedSymbologies = new[] { Symbology.Pdf417 };
```

Or, you want to exclude all the barcodes starting with 4 numbers:

```csharp
BarcodeCountSettings settings = new BarcodeCountSettings();

settings.FilterSettings.ExcludedCodesRegex = "^1234.*";
```

## Clear Screen Button

There are situations in which the user may find it helpful to clean up their screen (i.e. clear all the AR overlays) but keep the list of barcodes scanned.

If this is the case, you can enable the “Clear screen” button.

```csharp
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowClearHighlightsButton = true;
```

## Customize Overlay Colors

MatrixScan Count comes with recommended and user-tested AR overlays. However, if you wish to customize the overlay colors, once the overlay has been added, you can conform to the [IBarcodeCountViewListener](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view-listener.html#interface-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.IBarcodeCountViewListener) interface. The methods [IBarcodeCountViewListener.BrushForRecognizedBarcode()](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view-listener.html#method-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.IBarcodeCountViewListener.BrushForRecognizedBarcode) and [IBarcodeCountViewListener.BrushForUnrecognizedBarcode()](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view-listener.html#method-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.IBarcodeCountViewListener.BrushForUnrecognizedBarcode) are invoked every time a new recognized or unrecognized barcode appears. These can be used to set a brush that will be used to highlight that specific barcode in the overlay. Keep in mind that these methods are relevant only when using the style [BarcodeCountViewStyle.Dot](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view.html#value-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.BarcodeCountViewStyle.Dot).

```csharp
public Brush BrushForRecognizedBarcode(BarcodeCountView view, TrackedBarcode trackedBarcode)
{
// Return a custom brush
}

public Brush BrushForUnrecognizedBarcode(BarcodeCountView view, TrackedBarcode trackedBarcode)
{
// Return a custom brush
}
```

## Notifications

If you want to be notified when a user taps on an overlay, you need to implement the [IBarcodeCountViewListener.OnRecognizedBarcodeTapped()](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view-listener.html#method-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.IBarcodeCountViewListener.OnRecognizedBarcodeTapped) and [IBarcodeCountViewListener.OnUnrecognizedBarcodeTapped()](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/xamarin.ios/barcode-capture/api/ui/barcode-count-view-listener.html#method-scandit.datacapture.barcode.count.ui.IBarcodeCountViewListener.OnUnrecognizedBarcodeTapped) methods.

```csharp
public void OnRecognizedBarcodeTapped(BarcodeCountView view, TrackedBarcode trackedBarcode)
{
// Do something with the tapped barcode
}

public void OnUnrecognizedBarcodeTapped(BarcodeCountView view, TrackedBarcode trackedBarcode)
{
// Do something with the tapped barcode
}
```

## Disable UI Elements

The UI is an integral part of MatrixScan Count and we do not recommend that you use it without it. However, if you wish to disable UI elements you can do it as follows.

Disable buttons:

```csharp
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowListButton = false;
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowExitButton = false;
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowShutterButton = false;
```

Disable feedback and hints:

```csharp
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowUserGuidanceView = false;
barcodeCountView.ShouldShowHints = false;
```
