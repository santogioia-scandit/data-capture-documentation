### Parse and Sort Data

Scandit Express gives you several options to parse the scanned data for such formats as:

* Health Industry Barcodes (HIBC)
* GS1 Application Identifiers
* VIN Numbers
* Swiss QR Codes

You can parse and sort the scanned data either directly from Scandit Express, using the **Scan barcodes** tile in the **Scan and Export** section, or through keyboard injection. All scanning modes will return parsed data.

Please contact [Scandit Support](mailto:support@scandit.com) if you would like to have parser capabilities enabled in your account and we will support you with the necessary details for your specific use case.
